# ✨ Welcome to My Weird Little Website ✨

Hello, "user that accidentaly discovered this website"! You've stumbled upon my **chaotic corner of the web** — congratulations or no, depending on how you got here.

This is a website. It has things. Possibly even stuffs.

## 🧠 What this shit?

This site is the digital playground where i:

- publish some shits (when I remember)
- talk about my things, when i have time 🧻
- idk, just be stupid
- yell into the void (the void sometimes yells back)

## ⚙️ Tech Goblins I Used

The site was handcrafted with:

- 🍝 HTML / CSS (spaghetti-flavored)
- ⚡ i think that i use python (chaotic neutral)
- 🎨 youtube chaotic videos
- 🧙‍♂️ using turbowarp for shitting (depending on my mood)
- 🚀 Hosted my shits in the mystical cloud (aka Netlify)
